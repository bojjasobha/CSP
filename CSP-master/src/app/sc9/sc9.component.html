    <h1>WHAT HAPPENS TO A MALNOURISHED CHILD?</h1>
    <p>Malnutrition can take several forms. The term malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of nutrients.

        Undernourishment occurs when someone is deficient in nutrients. This can lead to wasting – when a person faces severe acute malnutrition and is dangerously thin. Wasting is potentially life-threatening. If undernutrition is not treated – particularly during the critical first 1,000 days of life when development occurs faster than at any age – they will experience stunted growth. Stunting is a chronic condition that inhibits a child’s mental and physical development.
        
        Children who experience stunting or wasting are also likely to suffer from diet related chronic diseases, weakened immunity and lower response to vaccines, making them more susceptible to various long-term health issues.
        
        In 2020, over 149 million children under 5 were affected by stunting, and 45 million affected by wasting – depriving them of the opportunity to achieve their full potential before they even reach school age</p>

                <li>Children suffering from stunting may never grow to their full height or develop their full cognitive potential</li>
                <li>43 percent of children under five in low and middle-income countries are at increased risk of poverty because of stunting</li>
                <li>Stunted children earn 20 percent less as adults than their non-stunted counterparts</li>
                <li>Mothers affected by undernutrition are more likely to have children who suffer from stunting or wasting, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and undernutrition</li>
            
            
                <li>Children who are less affected by stunting in their early years have higher test scores on cognitive assessments and activity level</li>
            <li>Well-nourished children are 33 percent more likely to escape poverty as adults</li>
            <li>All forms of malnutrition cost businesses in low- and middle-income countries between $8-38 billion per year.</li>
            <li><h3>The size of the problem</h3>Malnutrition is a common, under-recognised and undertreated problem facing patients and clinicians. It is both a cause and consequence of disease and exists in institutional care and the community. Approximately 5% of the UK population are underweight with a body mass index (BMI) below 20 kg/m2, although obese individuals who unintentionally lose weight and subsequently have a BMI within the normal range are also at risk of malnutrition. Other patients become at risk as a result of an acute event (eg small bowel infarction), leaving them unable to meet their metabolic requirements both in the short and longer term. The prevalence of malnutrition increases by at least twofold in the elderly and those with chronic disease, and threefold in individuals living in institutional care.2

                The prevalence of malnutrition in UK hospitals reported over the last 15 years ranges from 13–40%, many patients seeing a further decline in their nutritional status during hospital admission.3 A large survey conducted by the British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) in 2008 found that 28% of inpatients were at risk of malnutrition. The prevalence was higher in specific subpopulations: for example, 34% of all emergency admissions and 52% of admissions from care homes.4
                
                Specific micronutrient deficiencies are also common, especially in the elderly: for example, folate deficiency has been described in 29% of the independent elderly population and 35% of those in institutional care.5</li>
            <li><h3>Increased losses or altered requirements</h3>In some circumstances, such as enterocutaneous fistulae or burns, patients may have excessive and/or specific nutrient losses; their nutritional requirements are usually very different from normal metabolism.</li>
        <li><h3>Energy expenditure</h3>It was thought for many years that increased energy expenditure was predominantly responsible for disease-related malnutrition. There is now clear evidence that in many disease states total energy expenditure is actually less than in normal health. The basal hypermetabolism of disease is offset by a reduction in physical activity, with studies in intensive care patients demonstrating that energy expenditure is usually below 2,000 kcal/day. The exception is patients with major trauma, head injury or burns where energy expenditure may be considerably higher, although only for a short period of time.8,9</li></ul>

        <h2>Muscle function</h2>    
          <p>Weight loss due to depletion of fat and muscle mass, including organ mass, is often the most obvious sign of malnutrition. Muscle function declines before changes in muscle mass occur, suggesting that altered nutrient intake has an important impact independent of the effects on muscle mass. Similarly, improvements in muscle function with nutrition support occur more rapidly than can be accounted for by replacement of muscle mass alone.2,9

            Downregulation of energy dependent cellular membrane pumping, or reductive adaptation, is one explanation for these findings. This may occur following only a short period of starvation. If, however, dietary intake is insufficient to meet requirements over a more prolonged period of time the body draws on functional reserves in tissues such as muscle, adipose tissue and bone leading to changes in body composition. With time, there are direct consequences for tissue function, leading to loss of functional capacity and a brittle, but stable, metabolic state. Rapid decompensation occurs with insults such as infection and trauma. Importantly, unbalanced or sudden excessive increases in energy intake also put malnourished patients at risk of decompensation and refeeding syndrome.6</p>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>Malnutrition, which is often overlooked by clinicians, is common and has wide-ranging effects on physiological function. It is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality in hospital patients and significantly increases healthcare costs. Implementation of a simple screening tool identifies patients at risk and allows appropriate treatment to be instituted; this can significantly improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditure. Every doctor should recognise that proper nutritional care is fundamental to good clinical practice.14 By addressing deficiencies in education of all healthcare professionals and exerting influence through clinical leadership there can be genuine improvements in nutritional care.</p>
